<library>
<description>&lt;B&gt;PatternAgents Beautify Library&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;
Schematic Symbols for Design Beautification.
&lt;BR&gt;
Schematic and PCB layout libraries for design patterns by PatternAgents.
&lt;P&gt;
&lt;B&gt;Note Bene:&lt;/B&gt; This library uses no special characters in the Power Supply names.
&lt;BR&gt;
For example: Where most Eagle Libraries would use "+5V" for the net name for the main 5V rail,
&lt;BR&gt;
PatternAgents uses "5V0" to avoid any special characters that break other CAD tools.
&lt;BR&gt;
This is not a problem if you live only within Eagle, but once you want to bring your netlist into
&lt;BR&gt;
other CAD or Simulation tools, your netlist can become difficult to port to other tools.
&lt;BR&gt;
Trust us, we have years of experience at this...
